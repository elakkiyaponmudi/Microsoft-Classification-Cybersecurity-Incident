**Project Overview**

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model that predicts the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. The model classifies incidents into true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP) categories, using historical evidence and customer responses. The ultimate goal is to support guided response systems in providing precise, context-rich recommendations to SOC analysts, thereby improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.

**Business Use Cases**

The solution can be implemented in various business scenarios within the field of cybersecurity:

**Security Operation Centers (SOCs):** Automating the triage process to help SOC analysts prioritize their efforts and respond to critical threats more efficiently.

**Incident Response Automation:** Enabling guided response systems to suggest appropriate actions for different types of incidents, leading to quicker mitigation of potential threats.

**Threat Intelligence:** Enhancing threat detection capabilities by incorporating historical evidence and customer responses into the triage process.

**Enterprise Security Management:** Improving the overall security posture of enterprises by reducing false positives and ensuring prompt addressing of true threats.

**Approach**

**1. Data Exploration and Understanding**

**1.1 Initial Inspection:**

Load and inspect the structure of the dataset.

Understand the distribution of the target variable (TP, BP, FP).

**1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Use visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, correlations, and potential anomalies in the data.

**2. Data Preprocessing**

**2.1 Handling Missing Data:**

Identify missing values and decide on an appropriate strategy (imputation, removing rows, etc.).

**2.2 Feature Engineering:**

Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.

**2.3 Encoding Categorical Variables:**

Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

**3. Data Splitting**

**3.1 Train-Validation Split:**

Split the data into training and validation sets to tune and evaluate the model before testing on the test set.

Use stratified sampling if the target variable is imbalanced.

**4. Model Selection and Training**

**4.1 Baseline Model:**

Start with a simple baseline model (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree) to establish a performance benchmark.

**4.2 Advanced Models:**

Experiment with more sophisticated models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks.

Use techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning.

**4.3 Cross-Validation:**

Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure consistent model performance across different data subsets.

**5. Model Evaluation and Tuning**

**5.1 Performance Metrics:**

Evaluate the model using macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.

Analyze these metrics across different classes to ensure balanced performance.

**5.2 Hyperparameter Tuning:**

Fine-tune hyperparameters based on initial evaluation to optimize model performance.

**5.3 Handling Class Imbalance:**

Use techniques like SMOTE, adjusting class weights, or ensemble methods to handle class imbalance effectively.

**6. Model Interpretation**

**6.1 Feature Importance:**

Analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.

**6.2 Error Analysis:**

Perform error analysis to identify common misclassifications and potential improvements.

**7. Final Evaluation on Test Set**

**7.1 Testing:**

Evaluate the final model on the test set and report macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.

**7.2 Comparison to Baseline:**

Compare the test set performance to the baseline model and initial validation results to ensure consistency and improvement.

**Results**
